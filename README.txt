It is easiest to use Python IDLE

How to use:
1. Launch server (make sure port is the same as client port)
2. Launch client (make sure that the host is the host computer (127.0.0.1 is the host id for your computer))
3. Launch another client in another window
4. Whenever a client connects, the server will give some information on the connection
