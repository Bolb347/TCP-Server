The selector based server does not work
Use the threading server
How to use:
1. Launch threading server (make sure port is the same as client port)
2. Launch client (make sure that the host is the host computer (127.0.0.1 is the host id for your computer))
3. Your shell or command prompt will be spammed with "sent data" and "recieved data"+data on the client side and will be spammed with "sent data"+data and will say "accepted client"+a bunch of information about the client
